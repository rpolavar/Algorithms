# Algorithms
Various algorithms that coded by me.  I have intended to start with the book "Algorithm Design" by Jon Kleinberg and Eva Tardos and to implement them in Scala.  However, I was not able to convert the book into LaTeX.  Consequently, I could not comprehend the mathematical notation in it.  For now, I have decided to abandon the book.

My current plan is to go back to Cormen.  I started with Cormen roughly four years ago.  After chapter 2, I could not carry out my plan of plowing through the entire book.  I shall use the code and notes for the first two chapters from my past work.
