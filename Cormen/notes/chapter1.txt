Algorithms teach us a few different ways of solving a problem.  For example, recursion and divide-and conquer are  the ways that can be applied everywhere.
Not only correct algorithms but also incorrect algorithms may prove to be useful for us.  Finding large primes is an example.
The most important point in chapter 1 is that algorithms are still important.  Just refer to the problem in this chapter.  One must strive to get to super-linear complexity!  Obviously, it is not always possible.
